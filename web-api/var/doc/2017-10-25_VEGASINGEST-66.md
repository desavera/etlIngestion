# ADR 004: Branching Model

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

Currently, each B2W development team uses a branching model that will fit to your project. In this way the VEGAS project team discusses the model for your project.

This decision provide:

- Standardize the use of project branches.

## Decision

In order to address the requirements for the branching model we propose:

### Branching Model

The branching model will be created to standardize how the development team will work according the criterias:
1) It resembles the model (topic references) with a variation of the "sprint branch" for a FIXED branch called "sprints" instead of "develop";
2) It is based on a standardized proposal and with huge use and sources of discussions.

## Consequences

- We expect that this branching model will give a efective pattern, improving productiveness and motivation for the project and team respectively, as well as greater control of code repository.
