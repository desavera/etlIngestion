# Vegas Ingestion Tech Stack 

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

The choice of technology for Data Ingestion project in Vegas will drive the
development of the architectural modules languages and tools as well as
deployment technologies and should:

- Adequate to team and company culture
- Adequate to project challenges (i.e. functional and operational) 
- Facilitate project delivery in planned timeframe 

## Decision

In order to address the requirements for the technology stack we propose:

### Development language

The architecture is composed of two major modules and according to the
complexities and different scenarios we will adopt different technologies.
The versions for the toolkits will be chosen in accordance to tested
production experiences in the current environment:

- **API**: team expertise in JAVA justifies this major choice as SPRING is really
consolidated as a PRODUCTION solution for APIs developments
- **Ingestion Engine**: as being initially designed as an orchestrator for the
data flux in Data Ingestion of Vegas, this component was considered a good
candidate for a job instance container component in Scala. The language is very
well adapted to SPARK and the team has some experience as well as great
interest in getting more experience with functional programming
- JAVA version: JDK 1.8
- SCALA version: 2.11

### Development tools

The major tools for development will take advantage of the current environment
at B2W with continuous integration and versions for the toolkits will be chosen
in accordance to tested production experiences in the current environment:

- Spring Framework: 4
- Spring Boot Framework: 1.2
- Spark: 1.6
- Dependencies control: Maven (for JAVA) and SBT (for Scala)
- IDEs: IntelliJ is our major choice but users are free to use the ones you
like better

### Persistency

Vegas Ingest should use a simple relational database to store ingestion
definitions and related data, like executions and authentication tokens. Our
choice is to use a MySQL database running on HA, provided by the company's
platform.
 
### Deployment

- **API**: Docker is our choice as it is a company culture with our
Applications Platform running most of our products on a Dockerized
environment
- **Ingest engine**: a CHD cluster is our choice as it is available and ready
to receive Spark applications, using YARN

## Consequences

- By using a well known language with a great level of expertise from the team
for API development (i.e. JAVA) and also experiencing Scala as the Ingestion
Engine development languange we expect to be going on a safe direction that
will give high level of productiveness and motivation for the project and team
respectively
- The choice for Docker as the deployment technology also aims on
productiveness and internal environment compatibilities to address the
timeframe goal.
- The choice for spark on YARN ease the deployment configuration, using an
already established technology and platform
